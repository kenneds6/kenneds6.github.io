Hello!  I'm a AI research computer scientist at the Air Force Research Lab.  I am interested in **robust and secure machine learning**, **domain generalization and adapatation**, and human-facing **collaborative AI** systems.  

News
======
**[July 2024]** I presented our work investigating [the cognitive flexilibity of LLMs](https://openreview.net/pdf/60f5f4895744fa146cbb182a5ce6fdd55de1ca52.pdf) at the International Conference of Machine Learning Workshop on Large Language Models and Cognition in Vienna, Austria.  

**[July 2024]**  I presented our work on integrating cognitive models of human perception and vision transformers for adversarial robustness at the International Conference of Cognitive Modeling at Tilburg University, the Netherlands.  

**[December 2023]** Ryan McCoppin presented our work on [evaluating adversarial robustness](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10459757) at the IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA).  

**[August 2023]**  For the second year in a row, the 711th Human Performance Wing selected me to mentor an intern over the summer.  Goonmeet Bajaj, a Computer Science and Engineering PhD candidate at the Ohio State University, worked with us on addressing [knowledge gaps in visual question answering sytems](https://afresearchlab.com/lab-life/fights-on-issue-70-spring-2023/).  She also worked with us on [leveraging LLMs for cognitive architectures](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI-SS/article/view/27683) and presented this work at the AAAI Fall Symposium Series on the Integration of Cognitive Architectures and Generative Models.  

**[April 2023]** I received a DoD SMART Retention Scholarship.  I will be starting fall 2023 at the University of Wisconsin - Madison in the Computer Science PhD program.  

**[August 2022]**  The 711th Human Performance Wing awarded a summer internship to Dante Miller, a Computer Science PhD student at Rice University, who I mentored on a research project focussed on Case Based Reasoning for Explainable AI in a Clinical Domain.   

**[July 2022]** I attended ICML 2022 in Baltimore and presented a [blue sky idea](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05952) on human-in-the-loop implications for robust ML.
