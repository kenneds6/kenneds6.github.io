            <p style="font-size:36px; color: aqua;"> Hello</p>
            <p>My name is Sean Kennedy.  Welcome to my website.</p>
            <p>Scroll down and i'll tell you a little more about myself.</p>
        </div>

            <div id="about" class="aboutMe"><a href="about"></a>
                <p style="font-size: 36px; color: greenyellow">About Me</p>
                <p> I am currently a graduate student at UC pursuing a Masters of Science in Computer Science.
                <p>
                     My research interests include big data and data mining, and its applications to environmental and atmospheric science, machine learning and computer vision.
                 </p>
                <p>
                    In 2013, I graduated from the University of Cincinnati, summa cum laude, with a bachelor's degree in history.
                    When I began college in 2009, my family encouraged me to get a broad liberal arts education and I was drawn to
                    history as a major because of my interest in the subject.  I was afforded the opportunity to go beyond the routine
                    curriculum by researching, writing and presenting a paper as a Charles Phelps Taft Fellow in history.
                    You can find a link to and description of that work if you check out the My Work section of this website.
                    While I enjoyed history and the liberal arts education, I never intended to pursue history beyond college.
                    Instead, I was focusing on applying to graduate programs in atmospheric science.
                    While visiting one of the schools that I expected to apply to, a professor advised me to take a computer science class.
                    During my senior year, I took a yearlong course in Java programming and the fundamentals of computer science, which piqued my interest in the field.
                    Unfortunately, I was not able to take more computer science classes because I was graduating from the university.
                    I began to study programming languages (such as C and C++) and CS concepts on my own.
                    While I believe that it is possible to learn on your own, I value the educational experience that comes from having
                    interactions between fellow students and with professors.  That led me to pursue computer science study in a more formal
                    setting at the University of Cincinnati.
                </p>
                 <p>
                     I am an avid fisherman and I love the outdoors.  I enjoy hiking, biking, skiing, kayaking, camping
                     and a host of other hobbies that allow me to spend time in nature.
                     I also have a passion for video games and I enjoy following that industry closely.
