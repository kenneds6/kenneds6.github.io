    <p style="font-size: 36px; color: greenyellow">My Story</p>
    <p> I am currently a graduate student at the University of Cincinnati pursuing a Master of Science degree in Computer Science.
    <p>
        My current research interests include network security and applied cryptography. My research advisor is <a style="color: dodgerblue" href="https://homepages.uc.edu/~wang2ba/index.html">Boyang Wang, Ph.D.</a>
    <p style="font-size: 24px; color: aqua;"> How Did I Get Here?</p>
    </p>In 2013, I graduated from the University of Cincinnati, summa cum laude, with a bachelor's degree in history.
        When I began college in 2009, my family encouraged me to get a broad liberal arts education and I was drawn to
        history as a major because of my interest in the subject.  I was afforded the opportunity to go beyond the routine
        curriculum by researching, writing and presenting a paper as a Charles Phelps Taft Fellow in history.
        You can find out more about that work in the <a href="#mywork" onclick="scrollToMyWork()" style="text-decoration: underline; color: lightblue;" > My Work</a> section of this website.
        <!--# TODO: Rewrite Below-->
        While I enjoyed history and the liberal arts education, I never intended to pursue history beyond college.
        Instead, I was focusing on applying to graduate programs in atmospheric science.
        While visiting one of the schools that I expected to apply to, a professor advised me to take a computer science class.
        During my senior year, I took a yearlong course in Java programming and the fundamentals of computer science, which piqued my interest in the field.
        Unfortunately, I was not able to take more computer science classes because I was graduating from the university.
        I began to study programming languages (such as C and C++) and CS concepts on my own.
        While I believe that it is possible to learn on your own, I value the educational experience that comes from having
        interactions between fellow students and with professors.  That led me to pursue computer science study in a more formal
        setting at the University of Cincinnati.

    <p style="font-size: 24px; color: aqua;"> Places I've Worked At</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: lightgreen;"> University of Cincinnati</p>
    <p style="color: white;">I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the
        <a href="https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/facilities/149">University of Cincinnati Simulation Center</a>.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: lightgreen;"> Edaptive Computing, Inc.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">I spent the Summer of 2018 working as a Graduate Intern at <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/sbc/edaptive-computing-inc">Edaptive</a>.
        I researched state of the art machine learning and deep learning algorithms and developed prototypes to assess their
        performance on several different data analysis tasks.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 24px; color: aqua;"> Software</p>
    <p style="color: white;"> My <a href="https://github.com/kenneds6">Github profile</a> contains some of my recent projects.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 24px; color: aqua;"> Research</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Some of my research projects that I recently completed include a survey I coathured on lightweight cryptographic algorithms
        and their application to resource-constrained devices such as RFID smart cards and the IoT (which you can find
        <a href="https://github.com/kenneds6/research_samples/blob/master/LightweighCrypto.pdf">here</a>).
        I also recently completed research on the performance of several different
        machine learning classification algorithms' use in detecting malicious phishing URLs (accessible
        <a href="https://github.com/kenneds6/research_samples/blob/master/ML_Classification_URLs.pdf">here</a>).
        My ongoing thesis research concerns applied cryptography, security and privacy.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 24px; color: aqua;">History Works</p>
    <p style="color: white;"><a href="/kenneds6.github.io/Taft%20History%20Paper.pdf">This</a> is the research paper I completed as the result of my Charles Phelps Taft Fellowship
        that I presented at the <a href="/kenneds6.github.io/2013%20QCC%20Program.pdf">Tenth Annual Queen City Colloquium.</a>
        It is titled "The Historical Perspectives of Narco-Trafficking and Political Corruption in Mexico".
        I completed the research under the advisement of <a href="https://www.artsci.uc.edu/faculty-staff/listing/by_dept/history.html?eid=camposip">Isaac Campos, Ph.D.</a></p>
